<h1>Welcome to the E&Lpotatocards website!</h1>
<p class="important">Note: These aren't actually real pok&eacute;mon cards. They are all fan-made.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Card set 1:</h4>
<img src="Nidoran.jpg" />
<p>The Nidoran evolutionary lines became kind of awkward in Gen 2 and even more so in Gen 4. This fixes that... kind of?</p>
<img src="Nidorin.jpg" />
<p>Hypothetically the "rin" part should be pronounced "ree-n" but I keep pronouncing it "r-in"</p>
<img src="Nidoruler.jpg" />
<p>I was originally planing to use the colour of the female Nidoran line instead of the male Nidoran line for this evolutionary line but when I went on Pok&eacute;mon Fusion I ended up having these and kind of liking them</p>

<p>Do you remember what episode this was from? See, not every Johto filler episode was bad.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Card set 2:</h4>
<img src="Sandpoke.jpg" />
<p>It's kind of cute. Pok&eacute;mon in the TCG can only have one type but if it was in the games it would probably be a Ground and Psychic type.</p>
<img src="Sandbro.jpg" />
<p>Its head hasn't really changed much. I guess Sandshrew and Sandslash have similar looking heads?</p>
<img src="Lickifing.jpg" />
<p>This one just looks ridiculous...</p>
<img src="Ditlee.jpg" />
<p>It's quite an interesting concept and it's cute in a weird kind of way</p>
<img src="Vulithe.jpg" />
<p>The amber joke and the mushroom joke both work in the languages they are meant to work in, although it's kind of weird for a mushroom for go across the screen when talking about amber.</p>
<img src="Ninenine.jpg" />
<p>The name was an amusing coincidence and I wish the set was big enough that it could have been 9/x</p>
<img src="Meowchu.jpg" />
<p>I ship it so much. Also, I know that Meowth's Japanese name is officialy supposed to be Nyarth, but I just felt like using Nyasu, OK?</p>
<img src="Starstar.jpg" />
<p>This one's name works in the same way Ninenine's does. It would have been better to end this set with Meowchu, but this is ok...</p>
